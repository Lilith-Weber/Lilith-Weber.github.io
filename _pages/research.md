Lichens and Conservation Biology
*Lichen biodiversity is oven poorly known and risk assesments are difficult. During my Masters thesis and in volunteer work I am interested to learn what are the ways of protecting rare lichens? How do lichens react to anthropogenic disturbances? How can we use lichens for ecological surveys and ecosystem-level conservation? How can we increase awareness about these organisms?
