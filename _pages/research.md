Lichens and Conservation Biology
Lichen biodiversity is often poorly known and risk assesments are difficult. During my Masters thesis and in volunteer work I am interested to find ways of protecting rare lichens. How do lichens react to anthropogenic disturbances? How can we use lichens for ecological surveys and ecosystem-level conservation? How can we increase awareness about these easily overlooked organisms?
