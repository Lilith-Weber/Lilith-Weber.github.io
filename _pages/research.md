Lichen Ecology and Conservation

How can we maintain and restore biodiversity in a changing world? My research explores drivers of lichen diversity at multiple scales. What factors shape community composition? How do lichens react to anthropogenic disturbances? How can we use them as indicators in ecological surveys and ecosystem wide conservation?
Lichen biodiversity is often poorly understood and risk assesments range from difficult to impossible. Thats why I am particularly interested in increasing awareness of these easily overlooked organisms by connecting and communicating with diverse groups outside of academia. 

Projects:

During my Masters' thesis I investigated epiphytic lichens along an elevational gradient in the German National Park 'Bayerischer Wald' as part of the [BIOKLIM](https://www.npsumava.cz/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/sg_21_1_baessleretal.pdf) project. Forest structure variables and climatic factors were examined for their effect on the composition of species communities. Elevation proved to be more important than forest structure in driving taxonomic diversity and community assembly. Species richness and taxonomic diversity. In total 134 species were found, amongst them 12 new records for the region, a surpinsingly high number for an intensly studied area. Comparisons with investigations in 2006 and 2016 suggest a change in species composition in response to climate change.   

Another project, also undertaken in the Bayerischer Wald montane forest investigates the influnce substrate properties have on lichen communties on dead wood. Since the forest undergoes natural forest dynamics it harbors large amounts of standing dead wood after several severe storm events and subsequent bark-beetle proliferations. We recorded more than 3200 specimens from more than 144 taxa, inkluding several extremely rare and endangered species. Our initial findings suggest that the degree of wood degradation is one important factor determining species richness and community composition and key species are dependent on specific stages of decay, highlighting the importance of maintaining a diversity of available substrates.

While we know that many lichen species are known to be specialised to certain stages of wood decay, studies investigating these dynamics however are far more numerous from temperate or boreal biomes. Since wood decomposition happens at a much slower rate in the (sub)arctic, we chose to investigate community shifts in Finnish Lapland on bark and wood of mountain birch, comparing living and dead trees of different decay stages to learn what species are obligates on this ephemeral substrate.
