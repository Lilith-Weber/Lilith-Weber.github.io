This is Lilith Weber's personal website, here I write about my research & related projects!
I am currently a PhD student at the Finnish Natural History Museum at the University of Helsinki. I focus on lichen systematics, their ecology & conservation challenges. In my current project, I try to shine a light on (sub)arctic species diversity and study how climate change and snow depth affect them and what role humans and herbivores have on these sensitive ecosystems.
